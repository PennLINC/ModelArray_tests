  ### test on partial R2 #####
  " test purpose: 
  1. Even if there is NA in original y, we won't get NA for the sse. 
    THIS IS DONE by: to grab y.obs and y.pred from the actual model object: sum((full_mod$y-full_mod$fitted.values)^2)
    This is shown in case 2. In this case we also want to test if we don't need full.model for reduced model fitting (i.e. not using full.model$model as input data for reduced model)
  2. In addition, in even rare case, some observations are missing data for a variable in the full model but not in the reduced model (e.g. age is missing in one of the subjects).
    Make sure sse is not NA either in this rare case. 
    THIS IS DONE by: when fitting reduced model, using data from full model: full.model$model
    This is shown in case 1.
